        <p><i>Faith, I would love to tell you just how special you are. 
            On this joyful birthday celebration, I want to send my sincerest greetings to you. 
            I remember one of our late-night calls when you shared the story behind your name, Symon Faith, and how you felt it didn’t suit you. 
            But I’m here to show you that, without realizing it, you truly embody your name.</i></p>
        
        <p><i>I met you as the team captain in our clan and genuinely admire you for your seriousness and dedication to gaming. 
            Just like Simon Peter, the leader of the disciples, you are someone our team can rely on.</i></p>

        <p><i>You give your all to the people you love, and to me, that is the essence of faith itself. 
            I’ve called you Faith ever since because your second name reminds me of my faith in Him. 
            I remember you commented on how you thought of ‘Aly’ when I called you by your second name.
            That’s exactly why I chose it: I couldn’t come up with any other nickname because, for the first time, I wanted to call you by your name.</i></p>
        
        <p><i>Happy birthday, Symon Faith. 
            Thank you for the affection you bring into my life, and I’d love to shower you with even more love on this special day.</i></p>
