        <h2>Happy 22nd Birthday, my love~</h2>

            <p><i>Today marks my fourth year greeting you on your special day, and this one feels like the most special of all</i> ü§≠.
                <i>I, <b>your girlfriend</b>, wish you a happy, happy birthday and am so grateful to Him that you were born today.</i></p>
            
            <p><i>To my soulmate, I wish you good health and a long life.

            <p><i>As part of my gift, I have a simple request: cross your arms as if you‚Äôre hugging someone (or me), and gently tap your shoulders while you close your eyes. 
                This might help ease our longing for each other, lakay ko.</i></p>
            
            <p><i>I hope you love my humble gift, loveyyy. 
                I tried my best to recall, with my ‚ÄúDory‚Äù mind, those lessons on making a simple website. 
                I‚Äôm grateful to be part of your year's celebration and look forward to many more with you.</i></p>
